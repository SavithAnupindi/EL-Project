# EL-Project
Smart Silo Monitoring System is an Engineering Lab group project that provides real-time monitoring of grain inventory and storage conditions. It uses ultrasonic sensors for fill-level estimation and DHT11 sensors for temperature and humidity, with a Python (Tkinter) desktop application for visualization, logging, and alerts.
